## My Econote

Hi, I am a bachelor of economics. I will push something about the economics in this page in the days to come, including my study records, study materials and something I want to discuss with you. I wish we will have a good experience.

About the "Econote". It is a word which be created by myself, it is a combination of Eco and note. Eco, of course, is economics prefix, note means random record. 

In the next days, maybe I will publish something about Econometrics and Financial Engineering. In my opinion, these two subjects are important and full of charm. I hope one day I can learn them well.
